/**
 * This class generates Facebook-like social degree distribution
 * <p/>
 * A. Preparation
 * For a specific social network size (total number of persons)
 * 1) compute the mean value of social degree
 * 2) compute the range of each bucket (100 buckets) using the data from facebookBucket100.dat
 * B. Generate social degree for each person
 * 1) Determine the bucket (Take a random number from 0-99)
 * 2) Randomly select a social degree in the range of that bucket
