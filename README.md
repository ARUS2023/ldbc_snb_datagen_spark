LDBC SNB Data Generator
----------------------

![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/ldbc/ldbc_snb_datagen.svg?style=svg)

:scroll: If you wish to cite the LDBC SNB, please refer to the [documentation repository](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_snb_docs#how-to-cite-ldbc-benchmarks).

:warning: There are two versions of this repository:
* To generate data for Interactive SF1-1000, use the non-default [`stable` branch](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_snb_datagen/tree/stable) which uses Hadoop.
* For the Interactive workload's larger data sets (SF3000+) and for the BI workload, use the [`dev` branch](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_snb_datagen/) which uses Spark. This is an experimental implementation.

The LDBC SNB Data Generator (Datagen) is the responsible of providing the datasets used by all the LDBC benchmarks. This data generator is designed to produce directed labeled graphs that mimic the characteristics of those graphs of real data. A detailed description of the schema produced by Datagen, as well as the format of the output files, can be found in the latest version of official [LDBC SNB specification document](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_snb_docs).

## Quick start

### Configuration

Initialize the `params.ini` file as needed. For example, to generate the basic CSV files, issue:

```bash
cp params-csv-basic.ini params.ini
```

### Docker image

SNB datagen images are available via [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ldbc/datagen/) where you may find both the latest version of the generator as well as previous stable versions.

Alternatively, the image can be built with the provided Dockerfile. To build, execute the following command from the repository directory:

```bash
docker build . -t ldbc/spark
```

Then, assemble the JAR file and run the docker image using the mounted JAR, which will produce its output to the `out/social_network` directory:

```bash
tools/build.sh && tools/run.sh
```

The `out/social_network` directory is initially root-owned, to fix this, run:

```bash
sudo chown -R `id -u`:`id -g` out/
```

### Parameter generation

The parameter generator is currently being reworked (see [relevant issue](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_snb_datagen/issues/83)) and no parameters are generated by default.
However, the legacy parameter generator is still available. To use it, make sure you have Python 2 installed and run the following instructions:

```bash
mkdir substitution_parameters
# for Interactive
paramgenerator/generateparams.py out/build/ substitution_parameters
# for BI
paramgenerator/generateparamsbi.py out/build/ substitution_parameters
```

### Graph schema

The graph schema is as follows:

### Troubleshooting

* When running the tests, they throw a `java.net.UnknownHostException: your_hostname: your_hostname: Name or service not known` coming from `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.JobSubmitter.submitJobInternal`. The solution is to add an entry of your machine's hostname to the `/etc/hosts` file: `127.0.1.1 your_hostname`.
